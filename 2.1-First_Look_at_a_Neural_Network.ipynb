    "he problem we are trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 pixels by 28 pixels), into their 10 categories (0 to 9). The dataset we will use is the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset in the machine learning community, which has been around for almost as long as the field itself and has been very intensively studied. It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s. You can think of \"solving\" MNIST as the \"Hello World\" of deep learning -- it's what you do to verify that your algorithms are working as expected. As you become a machine learning practitioner, you will see MNIST come up over and over again, in scientific papers, blog posts, and so on."
